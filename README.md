download an array of files

The idea is to create an array of file URLs as well as individual filenames for each file such that you grab a list (maybe from a csv) and drop it into the page. Then click a button to download all of those files at once by looping through the download fucntion (in a seperate js file in this repo) this is for testing purposes only.
